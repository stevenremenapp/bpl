BPL Scavenger Hunt!

Scavenger Hunt created for BPL's Summer Reading open house. The idea is to encourage people to explore the renovated library
and participate in group events as well.

Download info (and codes to advance!) [here](https://github.com/stevenremenapp/bpl/blob/master/Info.docx) and see it live [here](https://stevenremenapp.github.io/bpl/).
