# Baldwin Public Library Scavenger Hunt!

This is a scavenger Hunt I created for BPL's Summer Reading open house. The event was designed to not only be an intro to the summer reading events, but also to introduce attendees to the recently renovated Adult Services wing of the building. The idea was to encourage people to explore the renovated library and participate in group events as well. Cloning this repo will give you all the files necessary to recreate this in your own library,

See it live [here](https://stevenremenapp.github.io/bpl/) and use these codes (one letter/code per stop: A, H, T, X, M, R, E, J, V, S) to advance to the end!
